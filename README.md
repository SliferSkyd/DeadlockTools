<h1> OS Tools </h1>
A simple tool for my Operating System course INT2214 to earn bonus marks.
This can also be useful in midterm and final examinations.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol> 
    <li>Banker algorithm and Deadlock Detection algorithm.</li>
    <li>Page Replacement algorithms (FIFO, Optimal, LRU, MRU, LFU, MFU, Second chance).</li>
    <li>(Future) CPU Scheduler.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Needed the appropriate JDK version to run it. Recommending using Intellij IDE. In the future, when everything will have been done, I will create a JAR file to use this tool more conveniently.

<h2>Note</h2>
This code has been only tested using some small testcases from my teacher and Youtube programming channels, so it may exist some bugs. I will not be responsible for your scores lost by using this tool. Please contact me if you find any issues.
